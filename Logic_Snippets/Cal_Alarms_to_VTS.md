# Calibration Alarms to VTScada

This logic sends valve calibration warning status bits to VTScada. These warnings indicate when a valve has reached its high or low limit switch during calibration operations, signaling that calibration may be required.

## Summary

This logic mirrors the calibration warning outputs to HMI but sends them to VTScada instead. The warning tags are generated by the valve position calibration AOI logic and indicate when a valve has reached its limits during calibration, which may require operator attention and potential recalibration.
